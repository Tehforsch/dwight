  abstract = {We have found provably optimal algorithms for full-domain discrete-ordinate transport sweeps on a class of grids in 2D and 3D Cartesian geometry that are regular at a coarse level but arbitrary within the coarse blocks. We describe these algorithms and show that they always execute the full eight-octant (or four-quadrant if 2D) sweep in the minimum possible number of stages for a given Px x Py x Pz partitioning. Computational results confirm that our optimal scheduling algorithms execute sweeps in the minimum possible stage count. Observed parallel efficiencies agree well with our performance model. Our PDT transport code has achieved approximately 68\% parallel efficiency with {$>$} 1.5M parallel threads, relative to 8 threads, on a simple weak-scaling problem with only three energy groups, 10 direction per octant, and 4096 cells/core. We demonstrate similar efficiencies on a much more realistic set of nuclear-reactor test problems, with unstructured meshes that resolve fine geometric details. These results demonstrate that discrete-ordinates transport sweeps can be executed with high efficiency using more than 106 parallel processes.},

We investigate how the existence of a massive black hole seed impacts the ionization and thermal state of its pre-galactic host halo and subsequent star formation. We show that its X-ray radiation ionizes and heats the medium, enhancing \$\textbackslash rm\{H\}\_2\$ formation in shielded regions, within the nuclear region in the span of a million years. The enhanced molecular cooling triggers the formation of a \$\textbackslash sim 10\^4\textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ metal-free stellar cluster at a star formation efficiency of \$\textbackslash sim 0.1\textbackslash\%\$ in a single event. Star formation occurs near the edges of the H II region that is partially ionized by X-rays, thus the initial size depends on the black hole properties and surrounding environment. The simulated metal-free galaxy has an initial half-light radius of \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ pc but expands to \$\textbackslash sim 50\$ pc after 10 million years because of the outward velocities of their birth clouds. Supernova feedback then quenches any further star formation for tens of millions of years, allowing the massive black hole to dominate the spectrum once the massive metal-free stars die.},

By writing the radiative transfer equations as a generalized conservation equation, we solve the transport part of these equations on an unstructured Voronoi mesh. We then solve the source part of the radiative transfer equations following Jiang et al (2014) using an implicit solver, and couple this to the hydrodynamic equations. The use of an implicit solver ensure reliable convergence and preserves the conservation properties of these equations even in situations where the source terms are stiff due to the small coupling timescales between radiation and matter. We present the results of a limited number of test cases (energy conservation, momentum conservation, dynamic diffusion, linear waves, crossing beams, and multiple shadows) to show convergence with analytic results and numerical stability. We also show that it produces qualitatively the correct results in the presence of multiple sources in the optically thin case.},

CRADLE (Cosmological Reionization And Deep LEarning) is an autoencoder convolutional neural network that uses two-dimensional maps of the star number density and the gas density field at z=6 as inputs and that predicts 3D maps of the times of reionization \$\textbackslash mathrm\{t\_\{reion\}\}\$ as outputs. These predicted single fields are sufficient to describe the global reionization history of the intergalactic medium in a given simulation. We trained the model on a given simulation and tested the predictions on another simulation with the same paramaters but with different initial conditions. The model is successful at predicting \$\textbackslash mathrm\{t\_\{reion\}\}\$ maps that are in good agreement with the test simulation. We used the power spectrum of the \$\textbackslash mathrm\{t\_\{reion\}\}\$ field as an indicator to validate our model. We show that the network predicts large scales almost perfectly but is somewhat less accurate at smaller scales. While the current model is already well-suited to get average estimates about the reionization history, we expect it can be further improved with larger samples for the training, better data pre-processing and finer tuning of hyper-parameters. Emulators of this kind could be systematically used to rapidly obtain the evolving HII regions associated with hydro-only simulations and could be seen as precursors of fully emulated physics solvers for future generations of simulations.},

In the context of the new standard {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology we point out confusions regarding the particle horizon, the event horizon, the `observable universe' and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity =               c               ). We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23{$\sigma$}.},

  abstract = {Load balancing refers to the practice of distributing approximately equal amounts of work among processors so that all processors are kept busy all of the time. When running massively parallel codes, load balancing is a priority in order to improve parallel efficiency. Load balancing is important in order to minimize idle time for all processors by equally distributing (as much as possible) the work for each processor. Here, we discuss load-balanced problems in terms of an (approximately) equal number of degrees of freedom per processor, provided that we are employing a partitioning scheme that minimizes idle time. Recently , an unstructured meshing capability was implemented in PDT, Texas A\&M University's massively parallel deterministic transport code, hence allowing the user to define more realistic problem geometries and to define 3D problems through the extrusion of 2D meshes. However, unstructured grids are significantly harder to load balance than logically-Cartesian meshes. In this work, we propose a load balancing algorithm that is now implemented in PDT in order to minimize a specific load-imbalance metric. Several numerical test cases are provided.},

  author = {Ghaddar, Tarek},
  abstract = {The field of radiation transport studies the distribution of radiation throughout a seven-dimensional phase-space consisting of time, space, energy, and direction. Radiation transport is described by the Boltzmann equation that can be solved stochastically or deterministically. The work presented in this dissertation utilizes the deterministic method known as the transport sweep, a popular technique that has been the subject of a large amount of research. We specifically focus on the parallel implementations of the transport sweep, and predicting the time it takes to sweep across a structured or unstructured mesh given a set of partitioning parameters, achieved through a time-to-solution estimator, written in Python. The time-to-solution estimator is tested against PDT, Texas A\&M's massively deterministic transport code. The time-to-solution estimator's sweep time is within 10\% of PDT's sweep time for the majority of problems tested. We use the time-to-solution estimator as the objective function in an optimization scheme to attempt to get the partitions that lead to the fastest sweep time for a given problem and partitioning scheme. Two optimization methods are discussed: using a black box tool (scipy's optimize library) and an intuitive method that prioritizes placing partitions in mesh locations that does not increase the number of cells (which we chose to name the CDF method). The time-to-solution estimator proved to not be smooth enough for a black box tool to work, so the CDF optimization method became the primary method. The CDF method proved effective for the majority of problems run, improving the time to solution over previously used partitioning schemes},

The suppression of H2 cooling is a necessary prerequisite for the gas to undergo direct collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. These black holes can then act as seeds for the growth of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts \$z \textbackslash sim 6\$. The viability of this model for SMBH formation depends on the critical ultraviolet field strength, Jcrit: if this is too large, then too few seeds will form to explain the observed number density of SMBHs. We show in this paper that there are five key chemical reactions whose rate coefficients are uncertain enough to significantly affect Jcrit. The most important of these is the collisional ionization of hydrogen by collisions with other hydrogen atoms, as the rate for this process is very poorly constrained at the low energies relevant for direct collapse. The total uncertainty introduced into Jcrit by this and the other four reactions could in the worst case approach a factor of five. We also show that the use of outdated or inappropriate values for the rates of some chemical reactions in previous studies of the direct collapse mechanism may have significantly affected the values of Jcrit determined by these studies.},

In order to determine \$J\_\{\textbackslash rm crit\}\$ reliably, we need to be able to accurately model the formation and destruction of H2 in gas illuminated by an extremely strong radiation field. In this paper, we use a reaction-based reduction technique to analyze the chemistry of H2 in these conditions, allowing us to identify the key chemical reactions that are responsible for determining the value of \$J\_\{\textbackslash rm crit\}\$. We construct a reduced network of 26 reactions that allows us to determine \$J\_\{\textbackslash rm crit\}\$ accurately, and compare it with previous treatments in the literature. We show that previous studies have often omitted one or more important chemical reactions, and that these omissions introduce an uncertainty of up to a factor of three into previous determinations of \$J\_\{\textbackslash rm crit\}\$.},

It scales as N logN with the number of hydrodynamic resolution elements and is independent of the number of sources of ionizing radiation (i.e. works equally fast for an arbitrary source function). We also describe an implementation of the algorithm in a Soften Lagrangian Hydrodynamic code (SLH) and a multi--frequency approach appropriate for hydrogen and helium continuum opacities. We present extensive tests of our method for single and multiple sources in homogeneous and inhomogeneous density distributions, as well as a realistic simulation of cosmological reionization.},

Our goal is to efficiently solve massively parallel problems with significant upscattering in the thermal energy range, for which the traditional iterative methods are converging too slowly. The presented methods are based on the two-grid diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA), originally developed for the Gauss-Seidel scheme, which we extend to the more parallelizable Jacobi iteration. Furthermore, we propose a new approach which ``boosts'' the convergence of the within-group iterations by performing additional group-by-group DSA solves. This removes the need for fully converged within-group iterations, further reducing the overall number of transport sweeps. We perform Fourier analyses for the proposed schemes and apply them to several practical problems using the parallel deterministic SN transport solver PDT. We also discuss how to cope with the increased number of diffusion solves in our ``boosted'' scheme and their effect on parallel scalability.},

To determine mesh element sweep ordering, we define a directed, weighted graph whose vertices correspond to mesh elements, and whose edges correspond to mesh element upwind dependencies. This graph is made acyclic by removing select edges in a way that approximately minimizes the sum of removed edge weights. Once the set of removed edges is determined, transport sweeps are performed by lagging the upwind dependency associated with the removed edges. The proposed algorithm is tested on several 2D and 3D meshes composed of high-order curved mesh elements.},

  abstract = {Radiative transfer simulations are now at the forefront of numerical astrophysics. They are becoming crucial for an increasing number of astrophysical and cosmological problems; at the same time their computational cost has come to the reach of currently available computational power. Further progress is retarded by the considerable number of different algorithms (including various flavours of ray-tracing and moment schemes) developed, which makes the selection of the most suitable technique for a given problem a non-trivial task. Assessing the validity ranges, accuracy and performances of these schemes is the main aim of this paper, for which we have compared 11 independent RT codes on 5 test problems: (0) basic physics, (1) isothermal H II region expansion and (2) H II region expansion with evolving temperature, (3) I-front trapping and shadowing by a dense clump, (4) multiple sources in a cosmological density field. The outputs of these tests have been compared and differences analyzed. The agreement between the various codes is satisfactory although not perfect. The main source of discrepancy appears to reside in the multi-frequency treatment approach, resulting in different thicknesses of the ionized-neutral transition regions and different temperature structure. The present results and tests represent the most complete benchmark available for the development of new codes and improvement of existing ones. To this aim all test inputs and outputs are made publicly available in digital form.},

  abstract = {The development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to follow gas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution of many problems in numerical astrophysics. Such fluid flows are highly complex, rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against which numerical codes can be tested. An alternative validation procedure is to compare different methods against each other on common problems, in order to assess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for the methods. Previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiative transfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). This is the second paper of the Cosmological Radiative Transfer (RT) Comparison Project, in which we compare 9 independent RT codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3 relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of an H II region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (I-front) in a 1/r\^2 density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniform dense clump. Results show a broad agreement between the different methods and no big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certain level of maturity and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and virtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one respect or another, with the majority of the results. This underscores the fact that no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particular features which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.},

It has several advantages compared to other approaches: its computational cost is independent of the number of radiation sources (unlike typical ray-tracing methods) and it is less diffusive than moment-based methods. Version 1 of sprai has already been shown to do an excellent job of modelling the growth of R-type ionization fronts in low-density gas. However, it does not perform so well with D-type fronts in denser gas unless run with a small time-step. Version 2 of the code addresses this weakness in the algorithm, allowing us to dramatically improve its performance in dense gas. Version 2 of sprai also includes two important updates to the microphysics treated in the code: a revised multifrequency framework that allows us to model helium photoionization, and a treatment of the effects of radiation pressure. In this paper, we describe these enhancements to sprai and also present several tests of the code.},

  abstract = {The most direct and strongest evidence for the presence of dark energy is provided by the measurement of galaxy distances using type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This result is based on the assumption that the corrected brightness of SN Ia through the empirical standardization would not evolve with look-back time. Recent studies have shown, however, that the standardized brightness of SN Ia is correlated with host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate, suggesting a possible correlation with stellar population property. In order to understand the origin of these correlations, we have continued our spectroscopic observations to cover most of the reported nearby early-type host galaxies. From high-quality (signal-to-noise ratio \textasciitilde 175) spectra, we obtained the most direct and reliable estimates of population age and metallicity for these host galaxies. We find a significant correlation between SN luminosity (after the standardization) and stellar population age at a 99.5\% confidence level. As such, this is the most direct and stringent test ever made for the luminosity evolution of SN Ia. Based on this result, we further show that the previously reported correlations with host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate are most likely originated from the difference in population age. This indicates that the light-curve fitters used by the SNe Ia community are not quite capable of correcting for the population age effect, which would inevitably cause a serious systematic bias with look-back time. Notably, taken at face values, a significant fraction of the Hubble residual used in the discovery of the dark energy appears to be affected by the luminosity evolution. We argue, therefore, that this systematic bias must be considered in detail in SN cosmology before proceeding to the details of the dark energy.},

Our evolution code, a version of TreeSPH (Hernquist \textbackslash\& Katz 1989) generalized to handle comoving coordinates and periodic boundary conditions, combines smoothed--particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with the hierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces. The Lagrangian hydrodynamics approach and individual time steps for gas particles give the algorithm a large dynamic range, which is essential for studies of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. The code incorporates radiative cooling for an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibrium with a user-specified ultraviolet background. We adopt a phenomenological prescription for star formation that gradually turns cold, dense, Jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova feedback energy to the surrounding medium. In CDM simulations, some of the baryons that fall into dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energy and condense into clumps with roughly galactic masses. The resulting galaxy population is insensitive to assumptions about star formation; we obtain similar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions from simulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation in which we identify galaxies directly from the cold, dense gas.},

The SPHINX simulations simultaneously capture the large-scale process of reionization, model the escape of ionising radiation from thousands of galaxies, and resolve haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold. This makes them an ideal tool for examining how reionization impacts star formation and the gas content of dwarf galaxies. We compare simulations with and without stellar radiation to isolate the effects of radiation feedback from that of supernova, cosmic expansion, and numerical resolution. We find that the gas content of cosmic filaments can be reduced by more than 80\% following reionization. The gas inflow rates into haloes with \$M\_\{vir\}\textbackslash lesssim10\^8M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ are strongly affected and are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the simulation without reionization. A significant increase in gas outflow rates is found for halo masses \$M\_\{vir\}\textbackslash lesssim7\textbackslash times10\^7M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Our simulations show that inflow suppression (i.e. starvation), rather than photoevaporation, is the dominant mechanism by which the baryonic content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is regulated. At fixed redshift and halo mass, there is a large scatter in the halo baryon fractions that is entirely dictated by the timing of reionization in the local region surrounding a halo. Finally, although the gas content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is significantly impacted by reionization, we find that most haloes with \$M\_\{vir\}\textbackslash lesssim10\^8M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ can remain self-shielded and form stars long after reionization, until their local gas reservoir is depleted, suggesting that local group dwarf galaxies do not necessarily exhibit star formation histories that peak prior to \$z=6\$.},

To this end, we introduce a self-consistent numerical framework that includes explicit treatments of feedback from star-forming molecular clouds (SFMCs) and massive black holes (MBHs). In addition to the thermal supernovae feedback from SFMC particles, photoionizing radiation from both SFMCs and MBHs is tracked through full 3-dimensional ray tracing. A mechanical feedback channel from MBHs is also considered. Using our framework, we perform a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation of a quasar-host galaxy at z\textasciitilde 7.5 for \textasciitilde 25 Myrs with all relevant galactic components such as dark matter, gas, SFMCs, and an embedded MBH seed of \textasciitilde{$>$} 1e6 Ms. We find that feedback from SFMCs and an accreting MBH suppresses runaway star formation locally in the galactic core region. Newly included radiation feedback from SFMCs, combined with feedback from the MBH, helps the MBH grow faster by retaining gas that eventually accretes on to the MBH. Our experiment demonstrates that previously undiscussed types of interplay between gas, SFMCs, and a MBH may hold important clues about the growth and feedback of quasars and their host galaxies in the high-redshift Universe.},

Although the use of synthetic acceleration greatly reduces the number of source iterations required for convergence, we have found that the time spent in inverting the transport operator still forms a large part of the overall computational effort. In today's production codes, this inversion is performed directly through the use of a transport sweep. Although a transport sweep is inherently a sequential operation, sweep algorithms which successfully vectorize (i.e., diagonal line sweeps) have been developed and implemented for vector machines such as the CRAY. However, with the advent of massively parallel SIMD architectures, it has been the accepted belief that an efficient algorithm for direct inversion of the transport operator could not be successfully adapted to machines such as the CM-2. Instead, interest has focused on alternative approaches to solving the transport equation, such as the second-order (even parity) form, or response matrix methods, which require an iterative inversion of the transport operator. The purpose of this paper is to show that an efficient algorithm for the solution of the standard, first-order form of the transport equation does exist for massively parallel architectures, and that the direct inversion of the transport operator can indeed be successfully parallelized.}

In popular cosmological models, the first sources of light began to form at a redshift z = 30 and reionized most of the hydrogen in the universe by z = 7. Current observations are at the threshold of probing the hydrogen reionization epoch. The study of high-redshift sources is likely to attract major attention in observational and theoretical cosmology over the next decade.},

  abstract = {We introduce the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of zoom simulations using the EAGLE model. We resimulate a range of overdensities during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) in order to build composite distribution functions, as well as explore the environmental dependence of galaxy formation and evolution during this critical period of galaxy assembly. The regions are selected from a large \$(3.2 \textbackslash;\textbackslash mathrm\{cGpc\})\^\{3\}\$ parent volume, based on their overdensity within a sphere of radius \$14\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash;\textbackslash mathrm\{cMpc\}\$. We then resimulate with full hydrodynamics, and employ a novel weighting scheme that allows the construction of composite distribution functions that are representative of the full parent volume. This significantly extends the dynamic range compared to smaller volume periodic simulations. We present an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), the star formation rate distribution function (SFRF) and the star forming sequence (SFS) predicted by \textbackslash flares, and compare to a number of observational and model constraints. We also analyse the environmental dependence over an unprecedented range of overdensity. Both the GSMF and the SFRF exhibit a clear double-Schechter form, up to the highest redshifts (\$z = 10\$). We also find no environmental dependence of the SFS normalisation. The increased dynamic range probed by FLARES will allow us to make predictions for a number of large area surveys that will probe the EoR in coming years, such as WFIRST and Euclid.},

Our sample consists of 8500 halos in M\_vir\textasciitilde 10\^8--10\^\{12\} M\_sun (M\_star\textasciitilde 10\^4--10\^\{10\} M\_sun) at z=5--12. We find the sample average {$<$}f\_esc{$>$} increases with halo mass for M\_vir\textasciitilde 10\^8--10\^\{9.5\} M\_sun, becomes nearly constant for M\_vir\textasciitilde 10\^\{9.5\}--10\^\{11\} M\_sun, and decreases at M\_vir{$>$}10\^\{11\} M\_sun. Equivalently, {$<$}f\_esc{$>$} increases with stellar mass up to M\_star\textasciitilde 10\^8 M\_sun and decreases at higher masses. Even applying single-star stellar population synthesis models, we find a moderate {$<$}f\_esc{$>\sptilde$}0.2 for galaxies at M\_star\textasciitilde 10\^8 M\_sun. Nearly half of the escaped ionizing photons come from stars 1--3 Myr old and the rest from stars 3--10 Myr old. Binaries only have a modest effect, boosting {$<$}f\_esc{$>$} by \textasciitilde 25--35\% and the number of escaped photons by 60--80\%. Most leaked ionizing photons are from vigorously star-forming regions that usually contain a feedback-driven kpc-scale superbubble surrounded by a dense shell. The shell is forming stars while accelerated, so new stars formed earlier in the shell are already inside the shell. Young stars in the bubble and near the edge of the shell can fully ionize some low-column-density paths pre-cleared by feedback, allowing a large fraction of their ionizing photons to escape. The decrease of {$<$}f\_esc{$>$} at the high-mass end is due to dust attenuation, while at the low-mass end, {$<$}f\_esc{$>$} decreases owing to inefficient star formation (and hence feedback). At fixed mass, {$<$}f\_esc{$>$} tends to increase with redshift. Our simulations produce sufficient ionizing photons for cosmic reionization.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of Population III (Pop III) stars and their remnants on the cosmological 21-cm global signal. By combining a semi-analytic model of Pop III star formation with a global 21-cm simulation code, we investigate how X-ray and radio emission from accreting Pop III black holes may affect both the timing and depth of the 21-cm absorption feature that follows the initial onset of star formation during the Cosmic Dawn. We compare our results to the findings of the EDGES experiment, which has reported the first detection of a cosmic 21-cm signal. In general, we find that our fiducial Pop III models, which have peak star formation rate densities of \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-4\}\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc\$\^\{-3\}\$ between \$z \textbackslash sim 10\$ and \$z \textbackslash sim 15\$, are able to match the timing of the EDGES signal quite well, in contrast to models that ignore Pop III stars. To match the unexpectedly large depth of the EDGES signal without recourse to exotic physics, we vary the parameters of emission from accreting black holes (formed as Pop III remnants) including the intrinsic strength of X-ray and radio emission as well as the local column density of neutral gas. We find that models with strong radio emission and relatively weak X-ray emission can self-consistently match the EDGES signal, though this solution requires fine-tuning. We are only able to produce signals with sharp features similar to the EDGES signal if the Pop\textasciitilde III IMF is peaked narrowly around \$140 \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have noted difficulties in modeling the highest opacities of the \$z{$>$}5.5\$ Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest, epitomized by the extreme Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ trough observed towards quasar ULAS J0148+0600. One possibility is that the most opaque regions at these redshifts contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen. This explanation, which abandons the common assumption that reionization ended before \$z=6\$, also reconciles evidence from independent observations of a significantly neutral Universe at \$z=7.5\$. Here we explore a model in which the neutral fraction is still \$\textbackslash approx 10\textbackslash\%\$ at \$z=5.5\$. We confirm that this model can account for the observed scatter in Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest opacities, as well as the observed Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ transmission in the J0148 trough. We contrast the model with a competing "earlier" reionization scenario characterized by a short mean free path and large fluctuations in the post-reionization ionizing background. We consider Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ and Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ effective optical depths, their correlations, trough size distributions, dark pixel fractions, the IGM thermal history, and spatial distributions of Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ emitters around forest sight lines. We find that the models are broadly similar in almost all of these statistics, suggesting that it may be difficult to distinguish between them definitively. We argue that improved constraints on the mean free path and the thermal history at \$z{$>$}5\$ could go a long way towards diagnosing the origin of the \$z{$>$}5.5\$ opacity fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The impact of the streaming motion between gas and dark matter on the first structure formation has been actively explored by recent studies. Here we investigate how much the key results are affected by two approximations made in many of those studies. One is to implement the streaming motion by accounting for only the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter while assuming "baryons trace dark matter" spatially at the initial conditions of the simulation. This assumption neglects the impact on the gas density taking place before the initialization. In our simulation initialized at \$z=200\$, this approximation overestimates the gas power spectrum up to 30\textbackslash\% at \$k\textbackslash approx10\^2\textasciitilde h\textasciitilde\textbackslash mbox\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ at \$z=20\$. However, the halo mass function and the gas fraction in halos are minimally affected. The other approximation is to artificially amplify the density/velocity fluctuations in a cosmic mean density volume at the initialization to simulate the first minihalos. This approximation gives a head start to the halo growth and the subsequent growth rate is as fast as in the mean density. The growth in actual overdensity, however, is accelerated gradually in time. For example, increasing \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ by 50\textbackslash\% effectively transforms \$z\textbackslash rightarrow\textbackslash sqrt\{1.5\}z\$ in the halo mass growth history while in 2-\$\textbackslash sigma\$ overdensity the acceleration is described by \$z\textbackslash rightarrow\{z\}+4.8\$. Halos in the former case are more grown than in the latter before \$z\textbackslash approx27\$ and vice versa after. The gas fraction in halo remains unchanged by this second approximation as well, suggesting that those approximations do \{\textbackslash it\{not\}\} bias the PopIII star-formation rate significantly.},

Our framework---which we term "Graph Network-based Simulators" (GNS)---represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework is the most accurate general-purpose learned physics simulator to date, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             At present, hydrodynamical simulations in computational star formation are either carried out with Eulerian mesh-based approaches or with the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. Both methods differ in their strengths and weaknesses, as well as in their error properties. It would be highly desirable to find an intermediate discretization scheme that combines the accuracy advantage of mesh-based methods with the automatic adaptivity and Galilean invariance of SPH. Here we briefly describe the novel AREPO code which achieves these goals based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. A particularly powerful feature is that the mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are given the velocity of the local flow, an accurate Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics is obtained that features a very low numerical diffusivity and is free of mesh distortion problems. If the points are kept fixed, the scheme is equivalent to a Eulerian code on a structured mesh. The new AREPO code appears especially well suited for problems such as gravitational fragmentation or compressible turbulence.},

We follow the evolution of a typical primordial star-forming cloud obtained from a cosmological hydrodynamics simulation. Several protostars form as a result of disk fragmentation and grow in mass by the gas accretion, which is finally quenched by the radiation feedback from the protostars. Our code enables us, for the first time, to consider the feedback by both the ionizing and dissociating radiation from the multiple protostars, which is essential for self-consistently determining their final masses. At the final step of the simulation, we observe a very wide (\$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\^4\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{au\}\$) binary stellar system consisting of \$60\$ and \$70\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ stars. One of the member stars also has two smaller mass (\$10\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$) companion stars orbiting at \$200\$ and \$800\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{au\}\$, making up a mini-triplet system. Our results suggest that massive binary or multiple systems are common among Pop III stars.},

  abstract = {Approximately two hundred supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been discovered within the first \$\textbackslash sim\$Gyr after the Big Bang. One pathway for the formation of SMBHs is through the collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs). A possible obstacle to this scenario is that the collapsing gas fragments and forms a cluster of main sequence stars. Here we raise the possibility that stellar collisions may be sufficiently frequent and energetic to inhibit the contraction of the massive protostar, avoiding strong UV radiation driven outflows, and allowing it to continue growing into a SMS. We investigate this scenario with semi-analytic models incorporating star formation, gas accretion, dynamical friction from stars and gas, stellar collisions, and gas ejection. We find that when the collapsing gas fragments at a density of \$\textbackslash lesssim 3\textbackslash times 10\^\{10\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{cm\^\{-3\}\}\$, the central protostar contracts due to infrequent stellar mergers, and in turn photo-evaporates the remaining collapsing gas, resulting in the formation of \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\^4\textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$ object. On the other hand, when the collapsing gas fragments at higher densities (expected for a metal-poor cloud with \$Z\textbackslash lesssim10\^\{-5\}\textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm Z\_\textbackslash odot\}\$ with suppressed \$\{\textbackslash rm H\_2\}\$ abundance) the central protostar avoids contraction and keeps growing via frequent stellar mergers, reaching masses as high as \$\textbackslash sim 10\^5-10\^6\textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$. We conclude that frequent stellar mergers represent a possible pathway to form massive BHs in the early universe.},

  abstract = {When solving the first-order form of the linear Boltzmann equation, a common misconception is that the matrix-free computational method of ``sweeping the mesh", used in conjunction with the Discrete Ordinates method, is too complex or does not scale well enough to be implemented in modern high performance computing codes. This has led to considerable efforts in the development of matrix-based methods that are computationally expensive and is partly driven by the requirements placed on modern spatial discretizations. In particular, modern transport codes are required to support higher order elements, a concept that invariably adds a lot of complexity to sweeps because of the introduction of cyclic dependencies with curved mesh cells. In this article we will present a comprehensive implementation of sweeping, to a piecewise-linear DFEM spatial discretization with particular focus on handling cyclic dependencies and possible extensions to higher order spatial discretizations. These methods are implemented in a new C++ simulation framework called Chi-Tech (\$\textbackslash chi\{-\}Tech\$). We present some typical simulation results with some performance aspects that one can expect during real world simulations, we also present a scaling study to \${$>\$$}100k processes where Chi-Tech maintains greater than 80\textbackslash\% efficiency solving a total of 87.7 trillion angular flux unknowns for a 116 group simulation.},

These simulations follow the non-linear evolution of galaxies modeling a variety of physical processes over an enormous range of scales. A better understanding of the physics relevant for shaping galaxies, improved numerical methods, and increased computing power have led to simulations that can reproduce a large number of observed galaxy properties. Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component. Cosmological simulations have also proven useful to study alternative cosmological models and their impact on the galaxy population. This review presents a concise overview of the methodology of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and their different applications.},

  abstract = {We introduce the public version of the cosmological magnetohydrodynamical moving-mesh simulation code Arepo. This version contains a finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics algorithm on an unstructured, dynamic Voronoi tessellation coupled to a tree-particle-mesh algorithm for the Poisson equation either on a Newtonian or cosmologically expanding spacetime. Time-integration is performed adopting local timestep constraints for each cell individually, solving the fluxes only across active interfaces, and calculating gravitational forces only between active particles, using an operator-splitting approach. This allows simulations with high dynamic range to be performed efficiently. Arepo is a massively distributed-memory parallel code, using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication standard and employing a dynamical work-load and memory balancing scheme to allow optimal use of multi-node parallel computers. The employed parallelization algorithms of Arepo are deterministic and produce binary-identical results when re-run on the same machine and with the same number of MPI ranks. A simple primordial cooling and star formation model is included as an example of sub-resolution models commonly used in simulations of galaxy formation. Arepo also contains a suite of computationally inexpensive test problems, ranging from idealized tests for automated code verification to scaled-down versions of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and is extensively documented in order to assist adoption of the code by new scientific users.},

  abstract = {We present self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic simulations of hydrogen reionization performed with Arepo-RT complemented by a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. We examine how photoheating feedback, due to reionization, shapes the galaxies properties. Our fiducial model completes reionization by \$z\textbackslash approx6\$ and matches observations of the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest, the CMB electron scattering optical depth, the high-redshift UV luminosity function, and stellar mass function. Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star formation rates by more than \$50\textbackslash\%\$ only in halos less massive than \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{8.4\}\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (\$\textbackslash sim10\^\{8.8\}\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$) at \$z=6\$ \$(z=5)\$, suggesting inefficient photoheating feedback from photons within galaxies. The use of a uniform UV background that heats up the gas at \$z\textbackslash approx10.7\$ generates an earlier onset of suppression of star formation compared to our fiducial model. This discrepancy can be mitigated by adopting a UV background model with a more realistic reionization history. In the absence of stellar feedback, photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than \$\textbackslash sim10\^9\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ at \$z\textbackslash gtrsim5\$, implying that photoheating feedback is sub-dominant in regulating star formation. In addition, stellar feedback, implemented as a non-local galactic wind scheme in the simulations, weakens the strength of photoheating feedback by reducing the amount of stellar sources. Most importantly, photoheating does not leave observable imprints in the UV luminosity function, stellar mass function, or the cosmic star formation rate density. The feasibility of using these observables to detect imprints of reionization therefore requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {In mesh-based numerical simulations, sweep is an important computation pattern. During sweeping a mesh, computations on cells are strictly ordered by data dependencies in given directions. Due to such a serial order, parallelizing sweep is challenging, especially for unstructured and deforming structured meshes. Meanwhile, recent high-fidelity multi-physics simulations of particle transport, including nuclear reactor and inertial confinement fusion, require \{\textbackslash em sweeps\} on large scale meshes with billions of cells and hundreds of directions. In this paper, we present JSweep, a parallel data-driven computational framework integrated in the JAxMIN infrastructure. The essential of JSweep is a general patch-centric data-driven abstraction, coupled with a high performance runtime system leveraging hybrid parallelism of MPI+threads and achieving dynamic communication on contemporary multi-core clusters. Built on JSweep, we implement a representative data-driven algorithm, Sn transport, featuring optimizations of vertex clustering, multi-level priority strategy and patch-angle parallelism. Experimental evaluation with two real-world applications on structured and unstructured meshes respectively, demonstrates that JSweep can scale to tens of thousands of processor cores with reasonable parallel efficiency.},
